# modSense Evaluation Results

## Overview

This repository contains the evaluation results of the modSense project, which utilizes generative AI to enhance the comprehension and creation of UML diagrams. Our evaluation involved generating interpretations for various test domains, specifically pottery making, organic farming, and bookbinding. Below, you will find the visual and audio content generated for these domains.

## Visual Content

The generated visual content for the test domains can be found in the `/data` directory. The images illustrate the application of AI-generated visual aids to enhance understanding in domains with intensive manual work.

- **Organic Farming**: ![Organic Farming](./data/ex2.png)
- **Bookbinding**: ![Bookbinding](./data/ex3.png)

## Audio Content

The generated audio content for the test domains is available in the `/data` directory. These audio files provide contextual explanations for the UML diagrams, further aiding comprehension.

### Audios

- **Bookbinding**: [Bookbinding Audio](./data/ex3.wav)

## Summary of Results

Our evaluation yielded positive results, particularly for diagrams where the temporal dimension is more visible. The visual generations were satisfactory when using basic UML models. However, we identified two primary reasons for not achieving better results across all UML types and audio generation domains:
1. The simplicity of the UML models chosen for the test.
2. The lack of engagement from modelers in customizing their requirements.

To address these issues, we are conducting an ongoing study that tracks UML creation and learning in a control group.
